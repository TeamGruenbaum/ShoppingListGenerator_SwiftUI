# ShoppingListGenerator

## Introduction
The ShoppingListGenerator is designed to help users to quickly and easily create their individual shopping list sorted by store and shelf. The first step is to select the desired dishes. In the second step, the desired ingredients are selected, whereby the ingredients required for the previously selected dishes are already preselected. Based on the selection, the sorted shopping list is then created. For the user, the advantages are that the shopping list does not have to be rewritten by hand each time and he does not have to wander around the stores looking for ingredients. Apart from this, the ShoppingListGenerator can also be used to create a cookbook with dishes and their recipes and to manage ingredients. This cookbook also serves as the basis for creating the shopping list.

The ShoppingListGenerator was developed using Swift and SwiftUI during our Bachelor‘s programme at Hof University of Applied Sciences in the lecture „Agile test and development methods in app programming“. It was also presented in a [post](https://informatik.hof-university.de/allgemein/studienarbeit-shoppinglistgenerator/) on the blog of the Faculty of Computer Science at our university.
